Questions:
* Should I use T Extends Comparator<T> or is T Extends Comparator okay?
* Some binary trees tutorial allows for duplications, others don't, which is right?

* If we can have a link to the child node, why don't we have a link to the parent node to make the tree bidirectional?
* It seems that a binary tree is different from a binary search tree, so when we talk about a binary tree are talking about binary search tree?
